## Dibyacodes's Neovim Setup

Putting out my neovim setup here just in case I smash my **arch** setup and mess up.

#### You can use it if you want to

Just give this repository a start so that the code works just fine and then copy the repository to `~/.config/nvim`

If you're using it, **have fun :)**
If you're seeing it, **give it a star**
If you use VS Code **Cute! I did too, but there I saw light.**
